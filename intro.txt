hi, krishna sai.
//push the file to the remote repository(firstrepo.git) in master branch.
git init
git add intro.txt
git commit -m "introduction"
git remote add origin https://github.com/krishnasai5/firstrepo.git
git push -u origin master

//create a second branch: second
git branch second
git checkout second
git push -u origin second

//update the intro file and push to second branch (the updated content is saved in second branch not in the master branch)
git init
git add intro.txt
git commit -m "update to introduction file"
git remote add second https://github.com/krishnasai5/firstrepo.git (in this context this line doesn't require becoz
we are pushing the file to same repo with another branch and we initialize the origin=remote repo url with another branch
from same repo)
git push -u origin second

//change branch from one to another.
git branch
git checkout second

//pull the file from a particular branch from remote repo to local: third is the branch name.
git clone -b third https://github.com/krishnasai5/firstrepo.git

//cherry-pick: (in same repo, you have two branches: 1. third, 2. fourth. take a particular commit from third branch and
make some changes and push the updated file into fourth branch.)
go to third branch:
git log (take 7 character short commit id otherwise pick whole id)
checkout to fourth branch:
git cherry-pick c377fcf
git status
git add intro.txt
git commit -m "cherry-pick from third branch commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/krishnasai5/firstrepo.git
git push -u origin fourth
